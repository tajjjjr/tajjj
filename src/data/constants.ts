    description: 'TAJJJR started as a casual conversation between six developers who shared the same frustration: too many ideas, not enough action. Instead of waiting for perfect conditions, we carved out our weekends and made them our creative playground. What began as simple experiments—testing concepts, building prototypes, challenging one another—slowly formed into a rhythm that felt bigger than a hobby. Those weekends laid the foundation for who we are today: a team born from curiosity, momentum, and the belief that progress happens when you create first and refine later.',

    description: 'Today, TAJJJR is more than a weekend experiment. We’re a team of six developers, designers, and innovators who thrive on turning ideas into working products in record time. Our builds are fast, bold, and functional—proof that creativity paired with execution creates tangible results. From prototype to small-scale launch, we’ve sharpened our skills, tested our limits, and proven that a compact, focused team can deliver what others might take months to achieve.',

Every weekend holds the potential for a breakthrough, and we’re committed to turning each idea into an opportunity that inspires, solves, and scales.',
